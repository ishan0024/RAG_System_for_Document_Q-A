Rag System For Document Q&A

Overview

The Rag System For Document Q&A is a powerful, user-friendly application designed to enable seamless question-answering capabilities over large document collections. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this system combines advanced natural language processing with efficient document retrieval to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers. Built with a modern tech stack, it supports a wide range of document formats and integrates with cloud-based storage and AI models for enhanced functionality. Ideal for researchers, businesses, and knowledge management teams, this project streamlines information retrieval and delivers insights with minimal latency.

Key Features
1. Document Ingestion and Processing: Supports multiple formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, plain text) with robust parsing and text extraction using libraries like PyPDF2 and python-docx.
2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Combines FAISS for efficient vector search with language models from LangChain and OpenAI for context-aware answers.

3. Interactive User Interface: Powered by Streamlit, offering a responsive web interface with features like live camera input, annotated text, and custom components for enhanced user interaction.
4. Cloud Integration: Seamlessly connects with cloud services (e.g., AWS S3 via boto3, Snowflake via snowflake-connector-python) for scalable storage and data management.
5. Customizable and Extensible: Modular design with dependencies like pandas, numpy, and plotly for data analysis and visualization, ensuring flexibility for diverse use cases.
